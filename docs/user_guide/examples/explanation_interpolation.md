# 📖 Interpolators Overview and API

Interpolation is an important functionality of Parcels. On this page we will discuss the way it is
implemented in **Parcels** and how to write a custom interpolator function.

```{note}
TODO: expand explanation (similar to Kernel loop explanation)
```

When we want to know the state of particles in an environmental field, such as temperature or velocity,
we _evaluate_ the `parcels.Field` at the particles real position in time and space (`t`, `z`, `lat`, `lon`).
In Parcels we can do this using square brackets:

```
particles.temperature = fieldset.temperature[particles]
```

````{note}
The statement above is shorthand for
```python
particles.temperature = fieldset.temperature[particles.time, particles.z, particles.lat, particles.lon, particles]
```
where the `particles` argument at the end provides the grid search algorithm with a first guess for the element indices to interpolate on.

If you want to sample at a different location, or time, that is not necessarily close to the particles location, you can use
```python
particles.temperature = fieldset.temperature[time, depth, lat, lon]
```
but this could be slower for curvilinear and unstructured because the entire grid needs to be searched.
````

The values of the `temperature` field at the particles' positions are determined using an interpolation
method. This interpolation method defines how the discretized values of the `parcels.Field` should
relate to the value at any point within a grid cell.

Each `parcels.Field` is defined on a (structured) `parcels.XGrid` or (unstructured) `parcels.UXGrid`.
The interpolation function takes information about the particles position relative to this grid (`grid_positions`),
as well as the values of the grid points of the `parcels.Field` in time and space, to calculate
the requested value at the particles location. Note that all grid values are available so that higher-order interpolation is possible.

## Interpolator API

The interpolators included in Parcels are designed for common interpolation schemes in Parcels simulations.
If we want to add a custom interpolation method, we need to look at the interpolator API:

We can write an interpolator function that takes a `parcels.Field` (or `parcels.VectorField`), a dictionary with the `particle_positions`
in real space and time, and a dictionary with the `grid_positions`.

The `particle_positions` dictionary contains:

```
particle_positions = {"time", time, "z", z, "lat", lat, "lon", lon}
```

For structured (`X`) grids, the `grid_positions` dictionary contains:

```
grid_positions = {
    "T": {"index": ti, "bcoord": tau},
    "Z": {"index": zi, "bcoord": zeta},
    "Y": {"index": yi, "bcoord": eta},
    "X": {"index": xi, "bcoord", xsi},
}
```

where `index` is the grid index in the corresponding dimension, and `bcoord` is the barycentric coordinate in the grid cell.

For unstructured (`UX`) grids, the same dictionary is defined as:

```
grid_positions = {
    "T": {"index": ti, "bcoord": tau},
    "Z": {"index": zi, "bcoord": zeta},
    "FACE": {"index": fi, "bcoord": bcoord}
}
```
